      I am a Software Developer with innate appetite for codes. Possess good understanding of web apps
       and MVC architecture. Experience in building Backend services, Rest APIs, Angular apps and 
       basic tools like git. Have experience in developing, deploying and maintaining web apps to 
       Heroku. Iâ€™ve also delivered a few freelancing tasks and had a stint with doing a startup even.

    <p>I am a self-driven, all-time learner, proactively ready to get on with new techniques and ideas 
      to upgrade myself and deliver value at the end of the day.</p>
